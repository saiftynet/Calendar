# Calendar

Objective create a general purpose calendar application in pure perl for the terminal

* Minimal dependencies
* Customisable (yearview, month view, show week number done in Version 0.01)
* Highlightable (done in Version 0.03)
* Import ICS files and appropriate highlighting (TODO)
* Interactive calendar  (TODO)
* Create iCAL files
 
### Version 0.03

The application has been renamed "paella".

* Dependency on DateTime removed (no extrernal modules required: this will be a monolithic, single file application)
* Decorations added, including borders
* Colours, blinking, underlining etc
* Calendars can be placed anywhere in the terminal window. (May eventually become a Term::Graille Widget)
  

### Version 0.01

* Experimental ways to colour dates
* A month is a 7/8 X 8 by grid with 3 characters in each
* Customisable horizontal and vertical spacing.
